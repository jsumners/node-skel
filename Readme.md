# node-skel

This is a simple CLI tool to initialize a new node project with some common
files. Currently, an [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file and a
Git ignore file are created. In the future, the tool may allow for more files;
possibly via switches or a prompt system.

## Install and Usage

```sh
$ npm install -g @jsumners/node-skel
$ mkdir foo-project
$ cd foo-project
$ npm init
$ nskel
```
